# keras-tools
This package contains tools for transforming data to be used in different Keras architectures.

## Features
### Multiple Input - Single Output

### Multiple Input - Mulitple Output

## Modules Under Development and Planned
- Universal prep
	- train_test_split: Function to create training and test data from different data sets
	- scale: minmax, standard, log, boxcox transformations to the data. Fit and transform train, transform test and validation only.
- RNNs
	- transform_for_rnn: Create time series data set (np arrays)
- CNNs
	- transform_for_cnn: Create np arrays
- Pre Model
	- get_input_shape: return input shape from training data for model
- Post Model
	- unscale: reverse scaling methods. User passes new array, gets back
	- ts_predictions: handle ts steps to predict for future
	- model_summary: Output model arch summary and
